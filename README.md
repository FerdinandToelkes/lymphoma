# Lymphoma Classification

This project contains everything that happens after the .sqlite data generated by *pamly* was preprocessed by <a href="https://github.com/FerdinandToelkes/patchcraft" target="_blank">Patchcraft</a>. Since the code was mainly meant for personal usage, it is not in the form of a package and thus a bit less structured, than the Patchcraft code.  

## Outline

The general structure of the project is as follows:

    - [after_patchcraft](#after_patchcraft)
    - [data_analysis](#data_analysis)

4. [visualize_preprocessing](#visualize_preprocessing)



# data_preperation

The initial situation is as follows: Patches are sampled via<a href="https://github.com/FerdinandToelkes/patchcraft" target="_blank">Patchcraft</a> and saved as individual files in different directories with the name of the corresponding slide from which the patches were sampled. This directory contains various scripts for further preparing the data for usage, as well as for analyzing the sampled data.
